CIFRE PhD student at ENS Paris-Saclay under the supervision of Nicolas VAYATIS and Mathilde MOUGEOT. My research focuses on ML model for time serie classification. It covers Anomaly Detection, Bayesian Modelling and Pattern Extraction. In collaboration with SNCF (French National Railway Transport), the applicative framework of my models is predictive maintenance on rolling stock.
